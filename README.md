# Candeeiro
This project is a visual novel developed for Brackeys gamejam 2022.1.
It was our first game as a team, and we are really proud of what we achieved.

# About the game

The theme was "It's not real"

This is a story where people are not sure if their beliefs are actually true or just pure fruit of their traumas. Follow the story of Alex, an agreste-steampunk-like robot who wishes with all his core (as he calls his heart) to confirm he is a true child, The paladin Galego who strives to follow his faith just to find it faltering, and Mandacaru, the royal mage that strives for individual power for the fear of not being in control ever again.

The game is set on a fantasy-medieval-agreste world. Inspired by our northeast brazillian culture :D
